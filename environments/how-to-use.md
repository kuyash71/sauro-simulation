# Directories for Environment Files:

## Worlds Files should be added into gazebo models dir: ~/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds

##### ( The directory of the gazebo depends on which version you download )

## Models Files should be added into gazebo models dir: ~/.gazebo/models

##### ( The directory of the gazebo depends on which version you download )

---

# EXTRA:

You can put the files in the models to ".gazebo" rather than "ardupilot_gazebo". In this project, I put
the model files into "ardupilot_gazebo" in order to keep the main gazebo files clean
