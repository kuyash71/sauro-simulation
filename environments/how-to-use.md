# Directories for Environment Files:

## Worlds Files should be added into gazebo models dir: ~/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds

## Models Files should be added into gazebo models dir: ~/.gazebo/models

---

# EXTRA:

You can put the files in the models to "ardupilot_gazebo" rather than ".gazebo". In this project
we put it into ".gazebo" because we you put the models into "ardupilot_gazebo" we wouldn't be able to use
the models in general gazebo projects.
